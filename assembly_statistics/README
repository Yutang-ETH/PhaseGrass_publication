asm_contig_stats is a snakemake file I used to generate assembly stats for the contig-level assemblies

asm_final_stats is a snakemake file I used to generate assembly stats for the final haplomes

get_accuracy_depth is a snakemake file I used to calculate the base-level accuracy and the long-read alignment depth
