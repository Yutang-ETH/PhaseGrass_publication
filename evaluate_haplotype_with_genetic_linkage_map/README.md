Comparing haplotypes of Sikem generated by PhaseGrass with haplotypes from a genetic linkage map of Sikem
The WHATIDID.txt recorded what I have done
The Snakefile is the GBS read mapping pipeline and SNP calling pipeline
However, to have phased alleles in the genetic linakge map, the SNP calling pipeline suggested by lepmap3 should be used, which is in lepmap3_variant_calling.sh
