# want to make genetic linkage map based on Sikem phased assembly with GBS data from Sikem x Rabiosa F1 population

# mkdir folders
mkdir GBS genome

# GBS data copied from P:\Pan_forage_grass\Raw_sequencing_reads\GBS\Rabiosa_Sikem_F1
# Sikem assembly was copied from juice_grass in Sikem_hifi, the h1 final assembly is used
# I just realized I should use assemblies from juicer_hifi instead of juice_grass

# GBS mapping and variant calling finished

# copy the R script here make_pedigree.R
# now make the pedigree file for lepmap3 with the sample names in the final vcf file
# work in the lepmap folder
