This folder contains scripts that were used to evaluate phasing quality by PhaseGrass

plot_phase_DH647.R visualizes the following:

1 chromosomes of Kyuss, the reference
2 distribution of gaps, 
3 distribution of snps phased by Hi-C,
4 compare phase generated by PhaseGrass with Kyuss phase
5 the chromosome-level phase blocks with SNP density
6 the small phase blocks with SNP density

Input data for 1 and 2 were obtained from Kyuss v2.0 publication

Input data for 4 were prepared with check_phase_chr_alignment_heatmap.R. One input file of check_phase_chr_alignment_heatmap.R was generated using get_phase.sh with the phased VCF from WhatsHap run by DipGrass. Another two input file for check_phase_chr_alignment_heatmap.R were from SNP_call_WGA_DH647
